	Created docs and CoreStdLib directories
	Copied language docs from old CoreProject
	Copied and edited Token and Lexer files from old CoreProject
	Created (partialy copied from old CoreProject) Utils/Defs, Utils/String, Utils/ErrorManager, Utils/File
	Copied Module/Annotations
	Created Lexer/ImportHandler
	Added extensions for git to ignore
	
	Commited as "Added Lexer"
	
	
	Included LLVM
	Copied INode, Expression, ValueExpr, Visitor
	Started experiments with LLVM (partial success)

26.01.2023
	Added Statement and Declaration basic classes (interfaces)
	In documentation, the language part, the owning concept, ref, move operators, overloaded function choosing were added
	In documentation, the annotations @move_only and @prefer were presented
	Parser module partially copied from old CoreProject
	Added simple compilation (must be edited)
	Now can compile and print a character with some code

	Commited as "Added Parser and simple compilation"

27.01.2023
	Added new Error management (with ErrorID, e.g. E1001, W1001)
	Added format strings' handling to lexer
	Began adding functions
	Created modules FunctionDeclaration, FunctionPrototype

29.01.2023
	Started adding symbol handling
	Created modules Compiler, ModuleSymbols, SymbolTable
	Module main.cpp cleaned, most of the content is moved to module Compiler
	Created modules Variable, Function, FunctionArgument
	Edited imports documentation
	Created module SymbolLoader

30.01.2023
	Created module Project
	Remade module Compiler, it's working now
	Created modules ReturnStatement, BlockStatemen, VariableDeclaration, FunctionExpr, FunctionCallExpr
	
	Commited as "Added functions and global variables"

31.01.2023
	Created a repository on GitHub, pushed the local repository there (in process, deleted large files from old commits)
	Fixed bug when compiler generated a new set of .o files each time (file.o, file1.o, file2.o, etc)
	Added new llvm PassManagers
	Fixed bug: program fails when freeing resources (somewhere in llvm destructors), used quick_exit(0)

	Commited as "Some bug fixes, new llvm PassManager"

01.02.2023
	Fixed bug with inability to use functions/variables, declared in imported modules
	Fixed bug when global constructors were created for global variables, initialized with a constant
	Started implementing type system
	Created modules LLVMUtils, Type, TypeNode, BasicType

02.02.2023
	Created modules Value, TypeParser

05.02.2023
	Some progress on creating type system: type parsing
	Note: typeof is parsed correctly, but only if the expression is a variable or a function
	Created module TypeConversionExpr

06.02.2023
	Added tools for type conversion, type system is mostly ready, apart from user-defined types
	Working type system

	Commited as "Added type system (without user-defined types), literals"

	Added function using function arguments in function body
	Added local variables

	Commited as "Added local variables"
